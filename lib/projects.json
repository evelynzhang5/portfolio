        "description": "In my above visualization, I explored how sodium content (grams per 100g of product) varies across the four NOVA food processing categories based on the NOVA classification system. While ultra-processed foods are often seen as nutritionally inferior and are expected to contain more added components like salt, after a thorough examination of the distribution of sodium across unprocessed, culinary ingredient, processed, and ultra-processed foods in the given dataset grocerydb.csv, I was able to challenge such assumption above and concluded that surprisingly Processed food(NOVA 2) has highest median sodium content.",

        "description": "In this project, we decided to explore the relationship between recipe ratings and the nutrition information.we are interested in investigating relationship between the meat inclusion of recipes and their user ratings. In particular, we wonder if recipes with meat tagged will get lower ratings due to consumerâ€™s expectations for healthier, more sustainable eating options. The dataset we are using contains recipes and ratings from food.com. We then get p-value of 0.0, which is less than 0.05. As a result, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that people rate recipes with meat in their tag lower than recipes without meat in their tag.",
